  <h2>Part I - Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This privacy policy applies from the moment you or your device starts using your phone, and explains what data about
    you is tracked or stored.
    <br /><br />
    No information about you or your data is shared with 3rd parties or used for anything other than enabling you to use
    the app for it's intended purpose.
    <br /><br />
    You have the right to request any and all personal data is removed. To do so please email
    professional@tim-finucane.com. Because currently this app does not use
    accounts, we may need more information to figure out which data belongs to you.
    <br /><br />
    The following information may be communicated and stored on a server outside of your device:
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Your location whilst the app is open - this is used to give you quests in your area</li>
      <li>The guesses you make whilst playing a quest - these need to be sent to the server so that when you make a
        correct guess the server can send you the next clue</li>
      <li>Your IP when you make internet requests to the server - this is automatically logged by the server</li>
      <li>The images and text that make up the quests you create or modify and submit to us - this is put on the server
        so other users may find the quests you create</li>
      <li>The information you enter when reporting a quest</li>
    </ul>

    Additional information may be kept on your device but is not communicated with our server or myself (Tim Finucane).
    <br /><br />
    NOTE: During use of the app, your camera will be active. Unless you are in the process of creating a quest, we do
    not record or keep any information not stipulated above about what your camera is capturing.
  </p>

  <h2>Part II - Terms and Conditions</h2>
  <p>
    You agree to not attempt to jeopardise the privacy of other users by maliciously probing our server in ways that
    don't follow intended use of the app.
    <br /><br />
    You agree when creating content (such as quests) in Cwfgry to not submit material that breaks local laws, is overly
    offensive, discriminatory, or breaches other terms of service in effect during usage of the app.
    <br /><br />
    You agree to hold harmless myself and Cwfgry should any user of this app violate the terms outlined in this
    document. We will cooperate with you on any material hosted or found in this app that might breach any laws or be
    overly offensive.
  </p>

  <h2>Part III - Final Note</h2>

    you to contact me at professional@tim-finucane.com
