I am always excited to learn new and upcoming fields of development, including machine learning, single page web apps/JavaScript everywhere, and anything else I can get my hands on. Apart from software I also enjoy music (I play the guitar and the piano, sing, and have a drum kit to bash occasionally), painting, and am learning die deutsche Sprache.\n\nI am looking for a job that encourages me to try new things and collaborate with other enthusiastic people. I can bring bright eyes and a bushy tail to the workplace (as long as that workplace has coffee)."
